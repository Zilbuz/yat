    u"""Add a task, a list or a tag

usage: %s add [task | list |Â tag] "<informations>"

Add a task, a list or a tag to the todolist, depending of the first argument
after "add". If the first argument after "add" isn't one of these, then "task"
is assumed.

Adding a task:
    When adding a task, you must provide the task's text, and optionnally some
    symbols to set the priority, due date, tags or list. The symbols are '*',
    '~', '^', '#' and '>'.

    '*' can be used to set the priority of the task, it must be followed by a number
    between 0 and 3. 
    Example: Yat.add "do the laundry *2".

    '~' would be used if you want to make a subtask for an already existing task. It 
    must be followed by the id number of the parent task. If no list/deadline/priority
    argument is provided, the default list/deadline/priority of the subtask will be the
    one(s) of the parent task.

    '^' can be used to set the due date of the task, it must be followed by a
    date of the form xx/xx/yyyy[:[h]h[:mm][am|pm]], where xx/xx is either dd/mm or
    mm/dd, depending of the cli.input_date option, and hh is the hour in 24 or
    12 hour format, depending of the cli.input_time option.
    Example: Yat.add "go to the cinema with Wendy ^12/02/2011:20".

    '#' can be used to set the tags of the task, it must be followed by the name
    of a tag. The tag name can be composed of anything but spaces. You can set 
    multiple tags for a task. If the tag doesn't exist, it will be created.
    Example: Yat.add "do my homework #work #important"

    '>' can be used to set the list of the task, it must be followed by the name
    of a list. The list name can be composed of anything but spaces. If the list
    doesn't exist, it will be created.
    Example: yad add "peanut butter >groceries"

    Apart from the tags, if a symbol is used more than one time for a task, the
    last one will be used.
    You can place the symbols anywhere in the task text.
    You can escape the symbols with \, for example: "the symbol \> won't be
    processed with this text". And of course, you also have to escape \ if you
    want to use it.
    If your task text uses none of the symbols that the shell can interpret, the
    double quotes are optionnal.

Adding a list:
    Just add a new list. The name can contain anything but spaces. The second
    argument can be the priority of the list. When the tasks will be displayed
    by lists, they will be ordered with this number. The default priority is 0
    and the "nolist" list has a priority of -1.
    Example: Yat.add list groceries 1

Adding a tag:
    Just add a new tag. The name can contain anything but spaces. The second
    argument can be the priority of the tag. When the tasks will be displayed by
    tags, they will be ordered with this number. The default priority is 0 and
    the "notag" tag has a priority of -1.
    Example: Yat.add tag work 5
